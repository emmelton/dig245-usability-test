  <h1>THE FACEBOOK DESIGN EXPERIMENT</h1>
  <h2>conducted by emma melton, caroline sigl, & duc-anh hoang</h2>
  <h3>WHAT IS THE DESIGN EXPERIMENT?</h3>
  <p>the design experiment is a short classroom-completed experiment to examine the usability of a website. our particular group selected Facebook as its site of choice to investigate. we outlined five basic tasks for the user to complete which
    allowed us to investigate the usability of Facebook’s user interface.</p>
  <h5>we evaluated the following:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>the focus of the user’s eyes and mouse</li>
    <li>the time it took to complete the task</li>
    <li>learnability (how easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design)</li>
    <li>the amount of mistakes the user made (recorded numerically)</li>
    <li>if the user improved the second time they performed a task (if applicable)</li>
    <li>how the user felt during and after the experiment</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>the tasks we chose to examine:</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>if the user could find and check their Facebook notifications</li>
    <li>if the user could navigate to the Davidson 2020-21 School Year Facebook group</li>
    <li>if the user could post to their Facebook page with the settings requirement that only their user could be able to see the respective post</li>
    <li>if the user could find the Fisher Farm page (a particular page by a group in Davidson, NC)</li>
    <li>if the user could add a detail to their profile</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>OUR STUDY</h3>
  <h5>the starting point:</h5>
  <p>the user was instructed to begin on the home page, which looked something like this:</p>
  <h5>what the test subject was told:</h5>
  <p>first, check your notifications.
    <br>
    now, go to Davidson 2020-21 School Year Facebook group
    <br>
    next, post so only you can see
    <br>
    okay, now, find the Fisher Farm page
    <br>
    finally, add a detail to your profile
  </p>
